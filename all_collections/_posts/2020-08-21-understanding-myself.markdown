What will be the best version of myself?

This part is essential to explore, and I might know a few things about it.

So this will be based on my experience and will be subjected to change based on my understanding.

Our perception of the best human being might be based upon what people around us think about us. However, it might be possible to think through this with reasoning and come up with the proper thinking about how we should be. But it will be foolish to assume that there won’t be any implicit biases.

From the beginning, when I just started thinking correctly, I always wanted to inspire others. There is no greater pleasure for me other than people saying “you inspired me to do this and become this” and till the point, it doesn’t become sustainable, I will keep at it.

For me, the best version will be the one who is continuously seeking things and who is curious about the world and want to know something. I always believed that one cannot know everything and don’t think it is even humanly possible. However, I want to think it is possible and try to live by that or rather die by that. 

The best version of myself should be able to articulate correctly, he should be able to express himself accurately and adequately. He should be able to think through the chaos of his thoughts and jot down what he wants to say. He should be a prolific writer, an excellent orator, should be able to express emotions clearly. I believe that there is nothing wrong with having emotions like anger and jealousy, that’s the part of our human nature, but the real issue is not to express it clearly which leaves it hanging. At the same time, it erodes you from the inside, which takes years to heal and still will be vulnerable to damage. The simple act of saying sorry from the heart should not find it difficult to reach to the mouth. He should be able to start the conversation during tensions.

The best version of myself should be able to know when to engage in conflict and when to not. It takes courage to fight, but it takes even more courage to let your ego down and avoid the conflict. He should be able to judge the situation correctly and prevent any dispute through reasoning and will.

The best version of myself should be able to think for himself. He should be able to generate ideas and the reason why he is thinking in a certain way. He should be able to create original ideas from simple observation and reasoning while being unbiased in the way.

He should be able to stand if he thinks he is right. He should be able to stand alone and reason through everything and come to an absolute conclusion about why this is right and stand by it. However, if he is challenged about his belief, then he should reason himself out and think through everything, before taking a stance.
